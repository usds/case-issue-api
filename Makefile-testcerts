# Makefile for creating self-signed certificates used by automated tests.
# Unlike the Makefile for manual tests, we do not use multi-valued RDNs, nor do
# we have a local certificate authority, because neither of those adds value to the tests

# In an ideal world this would probably be an incremental gradle task: for now, it
# is a seven-line Makefile, because Make makes some things a lot easier than Gradle.
